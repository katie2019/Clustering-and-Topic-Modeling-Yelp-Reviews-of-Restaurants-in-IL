Clustering and Topic Modeling Yelp Reviews of Restaurants in IL is my fourth project at Metis. 

In this project, I did clustering and topic modeling on Yelp reviews:

• Utilized MongoDB to store Yelp reviews and applied TF-IDF Vectorization to calculate word frequencies

• Performed SVD dimensionality reduction and normalization on vectorized text data and then applied K-Means Clustering 

• Used NLP techniques such as LSA, NMF and LDA to run topic modeling on Yelp reviews of restaurants in IL

Data is from https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge

Language: Python

Libraries: sklearn, nltk, pandas, matplotlib
